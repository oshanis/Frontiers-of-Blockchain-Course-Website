## Course Description

Frontiers in Blockchain Research is an advanced seminar course that explores the theoretical foundations, system architectures, and emerging research directions of blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies. The course examines seminal and influential works on consensus protocols, cryptography, smart contracts, and decentralized governance, alongside cutting-edge research on scalability, privacy-preserving computation, interoperability, decentralized finance (DeFi), and Web3 ecosystems. Through critical reading, student-led discussions, and research presentations, participants will analyze open challenges at the intersection of distributed systems, cryptography, economics, and socio-technical systems, and engage with current debates shaping the future of decentralized infrastructures. 

## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

1.	**Understand foundational blockchain principles:** Analyze the core concepts underlying blockchain systems, including distributed consensus, cryptographic primitives, immutability, and trust minimization, as established by seminal research.

2.	**Critically evaluate blockchain protocols and architectures:** Compare and critique major blockchain designs (e.g., Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake, BFT-style consensus, Layer-2 systems) with respect to security, scalability, decentralization, and real-world deployment constraints.

3.	**Assess security, privacy, and cryptographic guarantees:** Evaluate formal security models, attack vectors, and privacy-preserving techniques such as zero-knowledge proofs, secure multiparty computation, and cryptoeconomic incentives.

4.	**Examine programmability and smart contract systems:** Understand smart contract execution models, formal verification approaches, and common sources of vulnerabilities, and assess their implications for decentralized applications.

5.	**Analyze economic, governance, and socio-technical dimensions:** Investigate how incentives, governance mechanisms, regulatory pressures, and human behavior shape the stability and evolution of blockchain ecosystems.

6.	**Engage with cutting-edge research and open problems:** Read, present, and critique recent blockchain research papers, identifying limitations, open challenges, and promising future research directions.

7.	**[6000 level] Develop independent research skills:** Formulate research questions, synthesize insights across multiple papers, and communicate technical arguments clearly through written critiques and oral presentations.
