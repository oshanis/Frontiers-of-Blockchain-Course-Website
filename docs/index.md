# Welcome to Decentralized AI

## Course Description

**CSCI 4190/CSCI 6190 - Decentralized AI**

This course explores the design, implementation, and governance of Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that operate without centralized control over data, compute, or decision-making. As modern AI increasingly relies on centralized data monopolies and opaque infrastructures, this course examines alternative architectures that emphasize data sovereignty, privacy preservation, verifiable computation, and permissionless innovation.

Students will study the technical foundations of decentralization, including blockchain systems, smart contracts, decentralized storage, oracles, and zero-knowledge proofs, alongside core AI paradigms such as federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, decentralized inference, and autonomous agents. The course integrates blockchain programming with Solidity, smart contract security, and incentive design with advanced topics like zero-knowledge machine learning (ZKML), decentralized knowledge graphs, and agent-to-agent economies.

Through lectures and a substantial group project, students will design and evaluate decentralized AI applications spanning Decentralized Finance, Decentralized Science, content provenance, and AI governance via DAOs. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to critically assess decentralization claims, reason about trade-offs in performance and trust, and architect AI systems that align technical rigor with ethical and societal considerations.
